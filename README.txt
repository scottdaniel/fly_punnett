Targeted for iPad

Description: This is a program created for scientists and students working with the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Better known as the fruit fly, it has 4 chromosomes, although 1-3 are generally the ones we care about (the 4th is tiny and carries few genes). While the basic understanding of doing a Punnett sqaure is crucial in genetics, it becomes tiresome to do them over and over again. Also, everything gets more complicated when you are dealing with several different mutations. So, I've created this program to help with this process.

Use: You enter the mutations on each homologue of each pertinent chromosome for the Mom and Dad flies (a bit of anthropomorphizing, I know), tap on 'Breed!' and you get the genotypes of the progeny. At the same time, your cross (what fly geneticists call it when mom and dad make fly babies) gets stored in Core Data so that you can access it later if need be. You can also tap on 'Reset' to set every chromosome back to wild-type.
